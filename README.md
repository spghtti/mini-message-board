# Mini message board

## About this project

This is a solution to the Odin's Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board) to create a simple and quick message boarding using NodeJS and Express.

Unfortunately, since this project is hosted on glitch.me, the project will 'go to sleep' if not used and fall back to its original state. So, you'll only see messages persist within the last day or so.
